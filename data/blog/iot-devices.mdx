# IoT Devices

As more and more connected devices are being produced on a daily basis, the rise of smart devices are being readily available in the hands of consumers and business alike. Some of these devices have grown into remote access, being accessible worldwide as more of each component becomes portable, requiring less space for carrying. IoT(Internet of Things) is a new terminology that is being used in the field of software technology which requires the knowledge of sensors, and software technology in order to operate successfully. It can also be described as a network of physical objects that can include real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. One of the earliest forms of inter connected devices dates back to the 19th century, where these so called IoT devices where tested in prescribing measurements gathered from weather data and wildlife preservations, alongside radio waves and satellite communications. IoT is a digitalized system, which includes interconnected devices, objects, and smart controls aimed at providing a smarter environment. This does not need human supervision as it can provide unique identifiers and the ability to transmit data over a shared network. The proper mechanism to connect and assemble digital electronics ensures that the user receives a network connection amongst parsing a fractional subdomain portion that comprises of several encrypted and decrypted tokens inter-communicating between each other. There subsists a clear visual interface between the real and digitized world to which separates each communicated device. Alongside the hardware and the software of each device, there must be a mean of exchange occurring between each transmissible device. This layer might be referred to as the communication mechanism, where each single device is tied to the software and hardware aspect vitality. Once the hardware, software and communication protocol is substantiated, an IoT platform detriments a proper location for carefully processing data, managing states, analyzing solutions and problem-solving in a so-called IoT device management environment.
