# ASP.NET

ASP.NET is a type of web service that is used throghout the course of making web applications, and it can also be tied to the concept of Object Oriented Programming. Object Oriented Programming is a type of software that allows users to build large based applications such as writing code in different languages. Some of these Object Oriented Programs include Java, Python, Ruby, C++ as well as C#, which is built based on this concept of ASP.NET. There are a couple of features that make ASP.NET stand out from the rest, and that is the ability of using web services. Some other based languages are limited to the ability of having the same bit of computerized information shared across multiple devices & applications simultaneously causing the process to work so perfectly and even flawlessly. ASP.NET has the ability to manage this useful piece of advice that other similar markup languages still can't seem to process. However, with every pro, comes a con, and ASP.NET is not the one to improvise when it comes to bandwidth limitations. ASP.NET or more C#, created and maintained by Microsoft, still requires an HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) in order to support viewing on all browsers.

Not every user uses the same browser when they log into the world wide web. ASP.NET however manages to process all of the coding process similar to that of a normal application, and also making it a true crown winner when it comes to Object Oriented Programming to the Internet. Now what makes this program stand out from the crowd, is the ability to have complete compatibility with multiple languages into one mainframe, for example if a user is editing the application in the form of VB.NET interface and another user edits in C#, those two programs when combined, outputs the same results ASP.NET Markup Language would print. In more conclusional manner, ASP.NET is a great language to learn for someone looking to code more of a web based application and service adding details to a structured UI design.
